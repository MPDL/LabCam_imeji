<h1>LabCam - Capture your research</h1>
<h2>The LabCam Application</h2>
<p>The LabCam App enables to easily transfer scientific research data like photos or videos with various metadata (e.g. GPS Data, OCR) and automatically transfer them from android devices to an image repository, namely gluons*. </p>
<p>The app has a manual and an automatic upload function, easy login becomes possible via QR-Code and it allows individual metadata profiles. It also provides OCR function during uploading. User can give selected pictures text and audio notes as well. </p>
<h3>Easy Login</h3>
<p>Log into the LabCam App either with your username and password or by scanning your QR-Code. The code contains information about the personal account and the collection ID. Therefore you have to sign into the imeji platform you want to work with and scan the QR-Code of the collection with your mobile device.</p>
<h3>Manual and Automatic Upload</h3>
<p>There are two different ways for uploading your data: manual and automatic. The user can select and upload any pictures to selected collection. In contrast, the automatic upload is for large quantities of data. By enabling automatic upload function, any picture taken afterwards will be automatically uploaded to the collection that user has specified.</p>
<h3>Metadata Profiles</h3>
<p>Each collection has a metadata profile by default, which could contain information such as text, location, notes. On demand, user can also add/delete entries in metadata profiles. By uploading, LabCam will acquire all fields in the metadata profile and submit them along with the picture to the collection. This is specially useful if user wants to collect information directly from pictures.</p>
<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>The user could create text note and voice note for selected pictures. Text notes will be transferred to the server as part of the metadata by uploading.</p>
<h3>Uploading with Technical Metadata</h3>
<p>By uploading, LabCam will extract the information like “Make”, “Model”, “Geolocation” etc. from technical metadata and submit them along with the picture to the Server. This is specially useful if user wants to collect information directly from pictures.</p>
<h3>OCR Function</h3>
<p>By (manual and automatic) uploading, an integrated OCR function will recognise possible text in latin based language, bar codes, save them as an entry in Metadata and upload to Gluons along with picture. User can choose to activate or deactivate this function freely.</p>

<p>*Gluons is a playground for research data enrichment, structuring and sharing, which is based on the open source software imeji.</p>
